# DDQN Experiment

## succss Rate
10k, 13% with .10 exploration
15k, 20% with .10 exploration 
27k, 37% with  .05 epsilon time taken 

if i set to .10 
quickest time to beat level: 



## Hyper Params

DDQN:

0-10k start at epsilon 1 decay lr=0.0001, gamma=0.99, epsilon=1.0, epsilon_decay=0.999 min 0.1
10k - set to .35 and train

16, 16:800: Epsilon set to 0.3 and min set to 0.2 until 20k.



16801 - .3, min 0.05, decay 0.9995
